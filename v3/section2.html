        <h2>David Fincher</h2>
        <p>
            Fincher's style of film is well known in the film community, using signature methods of cinematography,
            lighting, plot structure, and music. His films always include low lighting, tracking shots, multiple
            plot
            twists, and emotionally visceral film scores.
