Characters:

"The things you used to own, now they own you."

"Without pain, without sacrifice we would have nothing. Like the first monkey shot into space."

"We’ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we’d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won’t. And we’re slowly learning that fact."

###### Fun FACTS:

#### The Narrator:

![Edward Norton as The Narrator](img/JACK.png)

###### Edward Norton

The narrator of the novel is never referred to by name. At the beginning of the novel, the Narrator is a frustrated corporate slave, living out a dull, emasculated life.

#### Tyler Durden:

![Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden](img/TYLER.png)

###### Brad Pitt

Tyler Durden is the Narrator’s imaginary alter ego, the embodiment of his “death drive” and repressed masculinity. In many ways, though, Tyler is more “real” than the Narrator himself...

#### Marla Singer:

###### Helena Bonham Carter

Marla Singer is the only major female character in Fight Club, and a vague “love interest” for both Tyler and the Narrator.

"A person had to work hard for it, but a minute of perfection was worth the effort. A moment was the most you could ever expect from perfection."

#### Bob/Robert Paulson:

###### Meat Loaf

The Narrator first meets Bob at a testicular cancer support group, where he learns that Bob, a former champion body builder, lost his testicles after abusing steroids. Eventually, Bob joins fight club, because he sees it as a way to reclaim his lost masculinity through pain and violence.

#### The Narrator's Boss:
